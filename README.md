# Physics-Simulator
C++ programs to simulate gravitational attraction/collisions between multiple bodies. The first written written with Allegro in 2012, the other rewritten in SFML in winter 2014.


This includes two physics simulators; one was one of the earliest complete C++ programs I've written, the other is a complete rewrite after my first semester in college. They use different graphics libraries (allegro and sfml respectively). I initially wrote the first as an excuse to play around with the graphics library (and to try to implement physics rules recently learned in Physics I). They account for gravitational forces and collisions. The first took a few weeks, the second a few days.
